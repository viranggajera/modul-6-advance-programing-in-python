# Q-30: What relationship is appropriate for Student and Person?

# ans:

# the space between what an educator is expected to do — build strong,
# secure relationships with students, families, and coworkers — and the level of social and emotional support educators actually receive.

# 1. Learn the science behind strong relationships.
# Research shows that the way a person relates to caregivers early in life can impact that
# person’s relationships later on.
# This gives educators the opportunity to, within their daily interactions, strengthen the ways
# their students relate to others throughout life.

# 2. Embrace the power of empathic listening.
# Empathic listening means listening to what a student has to say — a student’s
# “strong emotions and painful experiences,” says Marcus — and not responding.
# Now, not only is this person calmer and better able to solve their own problems,
# but they want to come back to you again, share more.

# 3. Practice genuine vulnerability.
# This practice fuels student-teacher relationships,
# but it is also key to creating an over-arching culture of safety in a school.
# If you are educating in person, you can practice sharing personal details in informal exchanges with both students and colleagues.

# 4. Provide educators with opportunities to do their own healing.
# Teaching is, at its core, interpersonal work.
# It requires high levels of emotional intelligence.
# When teachers are invited to engage in the therapeutic process of unpacking their personal stories and triggers,
# it can lead to social-emotional growth.
# The more that educators are able to improve their own social-emotional intelligence,
# the more students will be able to learn and feel safe.
