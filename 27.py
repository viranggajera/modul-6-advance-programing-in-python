# ans:

# Creating an instance of class..
# Instantiation refers to creating an object/instance for a class.

# Python getattr() Basically,
# Python’s getattr() built-in function is used to retrieve the value of the object’s attribute with the name string.

# One of the perks of using the setattr () function is to be able to set multiple attributes at once.

# The delattr() function will delete the specified attribute from the specified object.

# The hasattr() function returns True if the specified object has the specified attribute, otherwise False.
